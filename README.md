## How To Play

* Use the arrow keys to navigate which cell to place your mark (points) in.
* When you're ready to place your mark, use one of the number keys, 1 to 5.
* If it's a blank cell, you can place your points there.
* If you've placed points there before, you can only place a higher value. Your previous set points will be lost.
* If the opponent has placed points there, you can only place (and take over) the cell with a higher value. The opponents points are then lost.
